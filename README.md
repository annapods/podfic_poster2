# Podfic poster

I'm lazy so I decided to automatize my podfic posting process.
This is the second version, because I'm also a perfectionist and I wanted a real database with a real user interface.

## Licence

Mostly for me, but if it can be useful feel free to reuse any parts of it? MIT license I guess? I'll love you forever if you help me improve it, it's a mess.

## Documentation

Cf doc/ and TODO.md.

## Technologies used

- Gtk for the GUI
- SQLite for the database
- Python for everything else
